# Wireless Gesture-Controlled Robotic Arm (Beginner Version)

## 🔧 Overview
This is a beginner-friendly robotic arm project using wireless gesture control.  
The goal is to learn embedded systems fundamentals, wireless data transmission, servo control, and Git-based engineering workflow.

This project will be expanded later to include camera-based gesture tracking and inverse kinematics.

## 🧠 Learning Focus
- ESP32-to-ESP32 wireless communication
- IMU (inertial measurement unit) for gesture sensing
- Servo motor control and synchronization
- Embedded systems architecture and planning
- GitHub documentation and engineering habits

## 🛠 Hardware Used
- Microcontrollers: 2x ESP32
- IMU Sensor: MPU6050 (gesture input)
- Servo Motors: SG90 (x4)
- Power Supply: External 5V
- Communication: WiFi or ESP-NOW (wireless control)

## 📁 Project Structure
/code        → ESP32 code for gesture input and servo control
/assets      → Photos, videos, diagrams
/docs        → Design notes, wiring, and planning

## ✅ Status
- [x] Basic wireless setup
- [x] IMU calibration
- [ ] Servo angle mapping from IMU data
- [ ] Multi-joint control logic
- [ ] Demo video
- [ ] README polish + documentation

## 📸 Demo / Images

## 🔭 Planned Expansion
- Add inverse kinematics for precision control
- Use camera + computer vision (OpenCV or MediaPipe) for hand tracking
- Rebuild arm with custom CAD design (advanced mechanical version)
